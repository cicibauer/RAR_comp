# RAR model comparison (The title will be replaced by the manuscript title)

## Overview

## Directory

[R_code_illustration.Rmd](R_code_illustration.Rmd) contains R codes to fit the extended cosinor model and Harmonic Hidden Markov Model (HHMM). The R code for fPCA can be found in the [GitHub repo: fpca_NHANES](https://github.com/cicibauer/fpca_NHANES) for our published paper.

[Harmonic_HMMs.R](Harmonic_HMMs.R) is the standalone R script for calculating circadian oscillated (time-varying) transition probabilities and state probabilities from HHMM estimates.

[figure_RA_profile_HHMM.R](figure_RA_profile_HHMM.R) is the standalone R script to plot the Rest-Activity profile from HHMM estimates.

[two_Example_Subects_raw_actigraphy_data.Rds](two_Example_Subects_raw_actigraphy_data.Rds) provides the actigraphy data of two example subjects, presented in the manuscript, from NHANES 2011-2014.
